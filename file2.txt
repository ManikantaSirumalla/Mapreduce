There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in
which Sirius uttered Dumbledore’s name that told Harry that Sirius
was not very happy with the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden
upsurge of affection for his godfather.
“At least you’ve known what’s been going on,” he said bracingly.
“Oh yeah,” said Sirius sarcastically. “Listening to Snape’s reports,
having to take all his snide hints that he’s out there risking his life
while I’m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time . . .
asking me how the cleaning’s going —”
“What cleaning?” asked Harry.
“Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,” said Sirius,
waving a hand around the dismal kitchen. “No one’s lived here for
ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old
house-elf, and he’s gone round the twist, hasn’t cleaned anything in
ages —”
“Sirius?” said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any
attention to this conversation, but had been minutely examining an
empty goblet. “This solid silver, mate?”
“Yes,” said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. “Finest fifteenthcentury goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.”
“That’d come off, though,” muttered Mundungus, polishing it
with his cuff.
“Fred — George — NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. Weasley
shrieked.
Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second
later, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a
large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy
wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air
toward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a
halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents
everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed,


point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius’s right
hand had been seconds before.
“FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. “THERE
WAS NO NEED — I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS — JUST BECAUSE YOU’RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU
DON’T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY
TINY LITTLE THING!”
“We were just trying to save a bit of time!” said Fred, hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table. “Sorry Sirius,
mate — didn’t mean to —”
Harry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, who had toppled backward off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet. Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from
whence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.
“Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of
the table, “your mother’s right, you’re supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you’ve come of age —”
“— none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!” Mrs.
Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto
the table and spilling almost as much again. “Bill didn’t feel the need
to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didn’t Charm everything he met!
Percy —”
She stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her
husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden.
“Let’s eat,” said Bill quickly.
“It looks wonderful, Molly,” said Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate
for her and handing it across the table.
For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and
cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their
food. Then Mrs. Weasley turned to Sirius and said, “I’ve been meaning to tell you, there’s something trapped in that writing desk in the
drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just

be a boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at
it before we let it out.”
“Whatever you like,” said Sirius indifferently.
“The curtains in there are full of doxies too,” Mrs. Weasley went
on. “I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.”
“I look forward to it,” said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his
voice, but he was not sure that anyone else did.
Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by
transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each
time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry’s
bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape’s,
shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then
sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a
regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and
Ginny started requesting their favorite noses.
“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks . . .”
Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression
that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.
Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discussion
about goblins.
“They’re not giving anything away yet,” said Bill. “I still can’t work
out whether they believe he’s back or not. ’Course, they might prefer
not to take sides at all. Keep out of it.”
“I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who,” said Mr.
Weasley, shaking his head. “They’ve suffered losses too. Remember
that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near
Nottingham?”
“I think it depends what they’re offered,” said Lupin. “And I’m not
talking about gold; if they’re offered freedoms we’ve been denying
them for centuries they’re going to be tempted. Have you still not had
any luck with Ragnok, Bill?”
“He’s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,” said Bill. “He


CHAPTER FIVE
hasn’t stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the
Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him,
you know —”
A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of
Bill’s words. Fred, George, Ron, and Mundungus were rolling around
in their seats.
“. . . and then,” choked Mundungus, tears running down his face,
“and then, if you’ll believe it, ’e says to me, ’e says, ‘ ’ere, Dung, where
didja get all them toads from? ’Cos some son of a Bludger’s gone and
nicked all mine!’ And I says, ‘Nicked all your toads, Will, what next?
So you’ll be wanting some more, then?’ And if you’ll believe me, lads,
the gormless gargoyle buys all ’is own toads back orf me for twice what
’e paid in the first place —”
“I don’t think we need to hear any more of your business dealings,
thank you very much, Mundungus,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as
Ron slumped forward onto the table, howling with laughter.
“Beg pardon, Molly,” said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and
winking at Harry. “But, you know, Will nicked ’em orf Warty Harris
in the first place so I wasn’t really doing nothing wrong —”
“I don’t know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,” said Mrs.
Weasley coldly.
Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer;
George was hiccuping. For some reason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very
nasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large
rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his godfather.
“Molly doesn’t approve of Mundungus,” said Sirius in an
undertone.
“How come he’s in the Order?” Harry said very quietly.
“He’s useful,” Sirius muttered. “Knows all the crooks — well, he
would, seeing as he’s one himself. But he’s also very loyal to Dumble

dore, who helped him out of a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung around, he hears things we don’t. But Molly thinks
inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasn’t forgiven him
for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.”
Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry’s jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was
saying something, as the jeans had once been Dudley’s). He lay down
his spoon in a lull in the general conversation. Mr. Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning
widely, her nose now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured
Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on
the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase.
“Nearly time for bed, I think,” said Mrs. Weasley on a yawn.
“Not just yet, Molly,” said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and
turning to look at Harry. “You know, I’m surprised at you. I thought
the first thing you’d do when you got here would be to start asking
questions about Voldemort.”
The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of dementors. Where seconds before it had
been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone
around the table at the mention of Voldemort’s name. Lupin, who
had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary.
“I did!” said Harry indignantly. “I asked Ron and Hermione but
they said we’re not allowed in the Order, so —”
“And they’re quite right,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’re too young.”
She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched upon its
arms, every trace of drowsiness gone.
“Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to
ask questions?” asked Sirius. “Harry’s been trapped in that Muggle
house for a month. He’s got the right to know what’s been happen —”


CHAPTER FIVE
“Hang on!” interrupted George loudly.
“How come Harry gets his questions answered?” said Fred angrily.
“We’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you
haven’t told us a single stinking thing!” said George.
“ ‘You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,’ ” said Fred, in a highpitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother’s. “Harry’s not
even of age!”
“It’s not my fault you haven’t been told what the Order’s doing,”
said Sirius calmly. “That’s your parents’ decision. Harry, on the other
hand —”
“It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry!” said Mrs.
Weasley sharply. Her normally kindly face looked dangerous. “You
haven’t forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?”
“Which bit?” Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though readying himself for a fight.
“The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,” said
Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.
Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George’s heads turned from Sirius to
Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling
amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation
with her mouth slightly open. Lupin’s eyes were fixed on Sirius.
“I don’t intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,” said
Sirius. “But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back” (again,
there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), “he has
more right than most to —”
“He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Mrs.
Weasley. “He’s only fifteen and —”
“— and he’s dealt with as much as most in the Order,” said Sirius,
“and more than some —”
“No one’s denying what he’s done!” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. “But he’s still —”
“He’s not a child!” said Sirius impatiently.


“He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her
cheeks. “He’s not James, Sirius!”
“I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said Sirius coldly.
“I’m not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sometimes, the way you
talk about him, it’s as though you think you’ve got your best friend
back!”
“What’s wrong with that?” said Harry.
“What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however
much you might look like him!” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. “You are still at school and adults responsible for you
should not forget it!”
“Meaning I’m an irresponsible godfather?” demanded Sirius, his
voice rising.
“Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why
Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and —”
“We’ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you
please!” said Sirius loudly.
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. “Arthur,
back me up!”
Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and
cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when
he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he say, “Dumbledore
knows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will
have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters —”
“Yes, but there’s a difference between that and inviting him to ask
whatever he likes!”
“Personally,” said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as
Mrs. Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about
to get an ally, “I think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the
facts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather than a garbled
version from . . . others.”

His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that Lupin, at least,
knew that some Extendable Ears had survived Mrs. Weasley’s purge.
“Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around
the table for support that did not come, “well . . . I can see I’m going
to be overruled. I’ll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry’s best interests at heart —”
“He’s not your son,” said Sirius quietly.
“He’s as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. “Who else has he got?”
“He’s got me!”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. “The thing is, it’s been
rather difficult for you to look after him while you’ve been locked up
in Azkaban, hasn’t it?”
Sirius started to rise from his chair.
“Molly, you’re not the only person at this table who cares about
Harry,” said Lupin sharply. “Sirius, sit down.”
Mrs. Weasley’s lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into
his chair, his face white.
“I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,” Lupin continued.
“He’s old enough to decide for himself.”
“I want to know what’s been going on,” Harry said at once.
He did not look at Mrs. Weasley. He had been touched by what she
had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at
her mollycoddling. . . . Sirius was right, he was not a child.
“Very well,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice cracking. “Ginny —
Ron — Hermione — Fred — George — I want you out of this
kitchen, now.”
There was instant uproar.
“We’re of age!” Fred and George bellowed together.
“If Harry’s allowed, why can’t I?” shouted Ron.
“Mum, I want to!” wailed Ginny.


THE ORDER OF
THE PHOENIX
“NO!” shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. “I
absolutely forbid —”
“Molly, you can’t stop Fred and George,” said Mr. Weasley wearily.
“They are of age —”
“They’re still at school —”
“But they’re legally adults now,” said Mr. Weasley in the same tired
voice.
Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face.
“I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron —”
“Harry’ll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!” said
Ron hotly. “Won’t — won’t you?” he added uncertainly, meeting
Harry’s eyes.
For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn’t
tell him a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the
dark and see how he liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they
looked at each other.
“ ’Course I will,” Harry said. Ron and Hermione beamed.
“Fine!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “Fine! Ginny — BED!”
Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging and storming
at her mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall
Mrs. Black’s earsplitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried
off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only after he had returned,
closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table
again, that Sirius spoke.
“Okay, Harry . . . what do you want to know?”
Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had been obsessing him for a month.
“Where’s Voldemort? What’s he doing? I’ve been trying to watch
the Muggle news,” he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces
at the name, “and there hasn’t been anything that looks like him yet,
no funny deaths or anything —”


CHAPTER FIVE
“That’s because there haven’t been any suspicious deaths yet,” said
Sirius, “not as far as we know, anyway. . . . And we know quite a lot.”
“More than he thinks we do anyway,” said Lupin.
“How come he’s stopped killing people?” Harry asked. He knew
that Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone.
“Because he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself at the moment,” said Sirius. “It would be dangerous for him. His comeback
didn’t come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. He messed it
up.”
“Or rather, you messed it up for him,” said Lupin with a satisfied
smile.
“How?” Harry asked perplexedly.
“You weren’t supposed to survive!” said Sirius. “Nobody apart from
his Death Eaters was supposed to know he’d come back. But you survived to bear witness.”
“And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,” said Lupin. “And you made sure
Dumbledore knew at once.”
“How has that helped?” Harry asked.
“Are you kidding?” said Bill incredulously. “Dumbledore was the
only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of !”
“Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the
Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,” said Sirius.
“So what’s the Order been doing?” said Harry, looking around at
them all.
“Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can’t carry out
his plans,” said Sirius.
“How d’you know what his plans are?” Harry asked quickly.
“Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and Dumbledore’s
shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.”
“So what does Dumbledore reckon he’s planning?”
“Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,” said Sirius. “In
