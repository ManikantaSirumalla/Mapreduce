CHAPTER ONE
There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my
nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you’d have done . . .
He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon
seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to
be home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley
again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, Harry set off toward the park
gate.
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses
with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners
who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred
Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches
of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing
disapproving mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along
Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into view again; they were saying
their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped
into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.
“. . . squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was saying, to guffaws
from the others.
“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers.
“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley.
“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon.
“See you then,” said Dudley.
“Bye Dud!”
“See ya, Big D!”
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off
again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the
corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon
came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his
ease, humming tunelessly.
“Hey, Big D!”


Dudley turned.
“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.”
“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry.
“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again.
“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his
cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.”
“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled
into fists.
“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?”
“Shut your face.”
“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about ‘popkin’ and
‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them then?”
Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting
Harry seemed to be demanding all his self-control.
“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin
fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights
ago —”
“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley.
“Oh yeah?”
“He cheeked me.”
“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on
its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true . . .”
A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry enormous
satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as
though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the
only outlet he had.
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had
first seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia
Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the
streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps
were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on
the other.

“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley
said after a few seconds.
“What thing?”
“That — that thing you’re hiding.”
Harry grinned again.
“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose if you were,
you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at the same time. . . .”
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.
“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you’re not.
You’d get expelled from that freak school you go to.”
“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big D?”
“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound completely
convinced. Harry laughed softly.
“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have
you?” Dudley snarled.
“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat
up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on
about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?”
“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled Dudley, “and he was
out cold for twenty minutes after I’d finished with him and he was
twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing
out —”
“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry’s wand?”
“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley.
“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when it goes all
dark like this.”
“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled.
He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.
From the little he could see of Dudley’s large face, he was wearing a
strangely triumphant look.
“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, completely


14

DUDLEY DEMENTED
nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or
something?”
“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. “Talking in your
sleep. Moaning.”
“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night
in his dreams.
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched,
whimpering voice. “ ‘Don’t kill Cedric! Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s
Cedric — your boyfriend?”
“I — you’re lying —” said Harry automatically. But his mouth had
gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — how else would he know
about Cedric?
“ ‘Dad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo-hoo!’ ”
“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m warning you!”
“ ‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He’s killed
Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to —’ Don’t you point that thing at
me!”
Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel fourteen years’ hatred of
Dudley pounding in his veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now,
to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an insect,
struck dumb, sprouting feelers —
“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. “D’you understand me?”
“Point that thing somewhere else!”
“I said, do you understand me?”
“Point it somewhere else!”
“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?”
“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM —”
Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been
doused in icy water.

CHAPTER ONE
Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky
was suddenly pitch-black and lightless — the stars, the moon, the
misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening
was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total,
impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without
meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been resisting as hard as he
could — then his reason caught up with his senses — he didn’t have
the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that,
trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a
weightless veil.
Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear.
“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!”
“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!”
“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I —”
“I said shut up!”
Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The
cold was so intense that he was shivering all over; goose bumps had
erupted up his arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly
around, unseeing . . .
It was impossible. . . . They couldn’t be here. . . . Not in Little
Whinging . . . He strained his ears. . . . He would hear them before
he saw them. . . .
“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? What are
you d-do — ?”
“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis —”
But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been
dreading.
There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, some

16



DUDLEY DEMENTED
thing that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air.
“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I’ll h-hit you, I swear I will!”
“Dudley, shut —”
WHAM !
A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, lifting Harry off
his feet. Small white lights popped in front of Harry’s eyes; for the second time in an hour he felt as though his head had been cleaved in
two; next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and his wand
had flown out of his hand.
“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain, as
he scrambled to his hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in
the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley
fence, stumbling.
“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT AT
IT!”
There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s footsteps
stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him
that could mean only one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU
DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand
— come on — Lumos!”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in
his search — and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his
right hand — the wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him,
hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes,
sucking on the night as it came.
Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.


CHAPTER ONE
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his
feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him,
panic fogging his brain — concentrate —
A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s
robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry’s ears.
“Expecto Patronum!”
His voice sounded dim and distant. . . . Another wisp of silver
smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand — he couldn’t do
it anymore, he couldn’t work the spell —
There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter. . . . He could smell the dementor’s putrid, death-cold breath, filling his own lungs, drowning him — Think . . . something happy. . . .
But there was no happiness in him. . . . The dementor’s icy fingers
were closing on his throat — the high-pitched laughter was growing
louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head — “Bow to death,
Harry. . . . It might even be painless. . . . I would not know. . . . I have
never died. . . .”
He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again —
And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for
breath —
“EXPECTO PATRONUM !”
An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry’s wand; its
antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have
been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag
charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.
“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he
sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. “DUDLEY?
DUDLEY!”
He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley
was curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second de

18



DUDLEY DEMENTED
mentor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy
hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded
head toward Dudley’s face as though about to kiss him. . . .
“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the
silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The dementor’s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver
antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its
fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. The stag
cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.
Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze
swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry
stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to
normality. After a moment he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he was drenched in sweat.
He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in
Little Whinging . . .
Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking.
Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but
then heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising
his wand again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer.
Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her
grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string
shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway
out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight, but —
“Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked. “What if there are
more of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!”

W

hat?” said Harry blankly.
“He left!” said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. “Left to see
someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom!
I told him I’d flay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! It’s
just lucky I put Mr. Tibbies on the case! But we haven’t got time to
stand around! Hurry, now, we’ve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble
this is going to cause! I will kill him!”
“But —”
The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbor knew what
dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of
them down the alleyway. “You’re — you’re a witch?”
“I’m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was
I supposed to help you fight off dementors? He left you completely
without cover when I warned him —”
“This bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang on — it
was him! He Disapparated from the front of my house!”
“Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I’d stationed Mr. Tibbies under a car just
in case, and Mr. Tibbies came and warned me, but by the time I got

to your house you’d gone — and now — oh, what’s Dumbledore going to say? You!” she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley floor.
“Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!”
“You know Dumbledore?” said Harry, staring at her.
“Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn’t know Dumbledore?
But come on — I’ll be no help if they come back, I’ve never so much
as Transfigured a teabag —”
She stooped down, seized one of Dudley’s massive arms in her wizened hands, and tugged.
“Get up, you useless lump, get up!”
But Dudley either could not or would not move. He was still on
the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, his mouth shut very tight.
“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Dudley’s arm and heaved: With an
enormous effort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet. Dudley
seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in
their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go
of him he swayed dangerously.
“Hurry up!” said Mrs. Figg hysterically.
Harry pulled one of Dudley’s massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under his
weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously
around the corner.
“Keep your wand out,” she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria
Walk. “Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there’s going to be hell
to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk
about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery . . . This was
exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of — what’s that at the end of the
street? Oh, it’s just Mr. Prentice. . . . Don’t put your wand away, boy,
don’t I keep telling you I’m no use?”
It was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry Dudley along at the
same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but
Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement. He
